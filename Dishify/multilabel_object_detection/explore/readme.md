# Helpful Repositories for Scraping Images and Labeling Them.

A compilation of links to repositories that scrape images and labels them for
training building a dataset.  

Note: The data I compiled can be found in MyDish AWS S3 Bucket named:
  - [mydish-multilabel-objectdetection](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/mydish-multilabel-objectdetection?region=us-east-2)

    Ask your TL or SL for access to the MyDish AWS account.
