## Project Overview

### Installation and Set-Up

#### Step 1: Clone the master branch repo into your local machine
> git clone https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/MyDish-DS.git


#### Step 2: Install the virtual env on the main MyDish Directory,
It should be the directory containing the pipfile and pipfile.lock.
Once you're in that directory, install the packages.
> pipenv install


#### Other options: Install using the requirements.txt file
> pipenv install -r requirements.txt

Note: If it does not install, it is most likely due to an out-dated package.
Check the versions of the packages, delete if not needed, or specify the versions.


#### Step 3: Open the env
> pipenv shell


#### Additional Step:  Creating a conda env using requirements.txt

#### Create the conda environment and specify python version(3.7):
> conda create -n mydish python==3.7


#### Activate the newly created env:
> conda activate mydish


#### Install the requirements.txt file:
> pip install -r requirements.txt


#### Install kernel specification:
> python -m ipykernel install --user --name mydish


#### Now you can deactivate the env and start using jupyter notebooks/lab:
> conda deactivate


and, open up a notebook.


#### To install or uninstall packages, open up the env:
> conda activate MyDish


#### Then, install or uninstall a package
> conda install/uninstall some_package


Useful [Lambda Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VGKzkAEvU0&feature=youtu.be) on how to do this.

Note: Link may not work. If so, refer to the tool-kit in unit-4/sprint-1/day-1 and look for the DS11 Lecture video.

### Git WorkFlow
All developmental code should be pushed to the 'staging' branch, not masters.
Follow the Semantic Commits format for [Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)

#### Step 1: Make sure you're on the master branch
> git branch

#### Step 2: Create the staging branch in your local machine
> git checkout -b staging

#### Step 3: If there is an existing staging branch on the github repo, pull
> git pull origin staging

#### Step 4: Set staging branch to track master branch
> git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master staging

#### Step 5: During Development, push code to staging until api is ready for deployment.
> git push origin staging


Some extra tips on Git WorkFlow:

You can consider the staging branch as working code thats in development. In a team,
you don't want everyone pushing to staging because that can create merge conflicts.
Instead, create another branch that tracks staging, push with your new branch and
request a team member to review your code and merge with staging. This also applies
with staging and masters.

#### From staging, create another branch:
> git checkout -b feature/new_branch


#### Track staging:
> git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/staging feature/new_branch


#### Push the feature branch with your added modifications and request a review:
> git push origin HEAD or git push origin feature/new_branch


Once its been reviewed and merged, you can delete the branch in the Github Repo and
in your local machine by:


#### Leave the branch by checking into staging
> git checkout staging


#### Delete the feature branch
>git branch -d feature/new_branch or git branch -D feature/new_branch


#### Pull the new changes in the staging branch
> git pull origin HEAD or git pull origin staging

## API Overview

### Architecture
Not Yet Implemented.

### Endpoints

There is only one current deployed version which can be found locally in the Dishify/ Directory.

[Deployed AWS Endpoint](https://3z6kv0n0v6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/test/dishify)


### AWS Guide

To use this endpoint, give the api an image url, like this [one](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1133/5284/products/9781771644761_002_iart.jpg):

#### After /dishify, in the url, add ?imageURL=:
> https://3z6kv0n0v6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/test/dishify?imageURL=

#### And, give it a url of an image with text:
> https://3z6kv0n0v6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/test/dishify?imageURL=https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1133/5284/products/9781771644761_002_iart.jpg


### Local Testing

On running the API locally using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and the [Unittests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html):

#### Run the API locally

If not in the API/ directory:
> cd APi/

Run app.py:
> python app.py

#### Execute the unittests
> python -m unittest discover
